- [ ] convert optimore to python
- [ ] update 816-opt to python 3.6/3.7
    - many of the replacements (if not all) should be converted to multiline regex replacements
- [x] add 816-tcc source to tools (via [snes-sdk](https://github.com/optixx/snes-sdk))
- [x] add [wla-dx](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx) source to tools
    - They moved to cmake! :)
- [ ] convert 816-tcc to CMake
- [ ] build an example program to verify this all actually works
- [ ] Use [llvm to snes](https://github.com/luizperes/llvm-to-snes) instead of 816-tcc once it works
