- [ ] get tools building with cmake
    - [x] bass
    - [x] bin2h
    - [x] bin2txt
    - [x] constify
    - [x] gfx2snes
    - [x] smconv
    - [x] snestools
    - [x] wla-dx
    - [ ] 816-tcc
- [ ] convert optimore to python
- [ ] update 816-opt to python 3.6/3.7
    - many of the replacements should be converted to multiline regex replacements
- [x] add 816-tcc source to tools (via [snes-sdk](https://github.com/optixx/snes-sdk))
- [x] add [wla-dx](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx) source to tools
    - They moved to cmake! :)
- [ ] build an example program to verify this all actually works
- [ ] Use [llvm to snes](https://github.com/luizperes/llvm-to-snes) instead of 816-tcc once it works
- [ ] setup CI - I should have done this waaaay sooner
